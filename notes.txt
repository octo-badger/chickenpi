    - start on boot
        - /etc/rc.local
        - # as user pi:  run screen called 'chick', execute the chickenpi node app, on termination run bash (which stops screen from just terminating if you're in there enditing things)
        - su - pi -c "screen -dmS chick bash -c 'cd /home/pi/chickenpi; sudo node index.js; exec bash'"

    - add git repo
    - add light sensor (redundency?)
    - track time
    - json payload 
        - negotiated from pihub?
